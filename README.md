# mazeGame
A work in progress, I don't know anymore.

To-do:
-Game logic: maze designs (deepslate and stronghold).
-Fix the game loop to allow multiple gameplays when you reach the finish coordinates.
-Fix the stone textures after the second time and beyond.
-If we have time: pause screen.
-Random textures.
