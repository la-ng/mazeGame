# mazeGame
A work in progress, I don't know anymore.

To-do:
-Game logic: start/finish coordinates, player spawns at a start node, game finishes when player goes to finish node), initial maze design.
-Start Screen (two buttons, one for deepslate map, one for stronghold map)(?)
-Pause(?) screen while ingame
