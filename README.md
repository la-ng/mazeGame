# mazeGame
A work in progress, I don't know anymore.

To-do:
- Game logic: maze designs (stronghold and maybe some smaller maps for tutorial purposes).
- Random textures for Stronghold.
- Add more effects: fog, glow, bloom, motion blur, depth of field, etc.
- Maybe remove ceiling and add a cool sky
